abstract: This briefing is part of a large four-year PhD project assessing the extent, sequence, pace and spatial pattern of neighbourhood change in Britain over a 40-year period from 1971 to 2011. The project is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Ordnance Survey through the Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training. Key points. Between 1971 and 2011, struggling neighbourhoods remained largely concentrated in North West, North East England and Scotland. More affluent and thriving neighbourhoods clustered across London, South East and South West England. There was a considerable decline in the number of struggling neighbourhoods in Scotland between 1971 and 2011. Major British cities experienced large increases in the number of multicultural neighbourhoods. Rural and suburban areas have remained home to thriving and mixed workers suburban neighbourhood types. The number of thriving and mixed workers communities neighbourhood types has undergone a considerable rise. Blue collar families neighbourhoods have practically disappeared.
