abstract: Recent developments and discussions concerning the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the development of a vaccine illustrate once again the necessity to assume that scientific claims are supported by solid evidence. In recent years, however, we see increasing evidence that casts doubts on this assumption. As a result, there is an increasingly urgent call for validation and verification of published research results, both within the academic community and the public at large. This is particularly important at a time when the scale and complexity of scientific studies grow, and replicability and reproducibility of scientific research has gained salience.
