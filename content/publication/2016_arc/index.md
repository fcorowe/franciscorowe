abstract: Despite the trend of regional youth out-migration being a long-standing one, we know relatively little about the potential role of return migration. The question therefore remains is the regional net gain in older age groups due to young adults returning ‘home’ from Melbourne or is it due to metropolitan residents deciding to leave the large city for a smaller centre or rural lifestyle? This research has used a combination of longitudinal and survey-based data sources to gain insights into migration pathways and potential return migration. The findings from this research are important for policy makers who deal with population and attraction strategies, either at local or state government level. These decisions makers form the audience for this report.
