abstract: Accommodating transparent research in Regional Science is a cornerstone of REGION. By its very nature as an online and open access journal, the contributions are made available to everyone. As it does not charge any submission fees, the journal is inclusive and invites contributions from across the globe. Also, in the longstanding and successful Resources section, REGION aims to unlock available datasets, visualization techniques and empirical approaches for a large audience. We are now proud to present two new types of publication that further accommodate transparent research in Regional Science, The Discussion section, and Computational Notebooks.
