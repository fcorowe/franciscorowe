abstract: Administrative areas are arbitrarily designed and do not necessarily reflect the geographical patterns of socio-economic and labor market activity. Labor market areas (LMAs) are required to analyze spatial labor market activity and provide a framework to guide spatially-explicit employment policy development. This resource describes a data source of a set of recently created labor market areas for Chile.
