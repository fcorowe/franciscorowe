abstract: Prior work has examined changes in the patterns of socio-economic residential segregation in Latin America metropolitan cities. Yet the influence of internal migration on shaping these patterns has remained unexplored. This paper aims to determine and assess the impacts of internal migration on residential educational segregation in the Greater Santiago Metropolitan Area (GSMA). We focus on educational segregation as education is a major determinant for income, particularly in Latin America and enables to leverage on the comprehensive geographical coverage of the Chilean census, which does not collect income information.
