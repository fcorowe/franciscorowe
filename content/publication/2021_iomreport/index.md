abstract: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against migrants – particularly individuals of Asian descent – have increased worldwide. Yet the lack of accurate and timely data has prevented a large-scale analysis of these developments. This report introduces a novel framework for using Twitter data to measure and monitor shifts in public sentiment towards migrants, complementing traditional data sources.
