abstract: This report seeks to examine the migration patterns of young adults in Victoria by drawing on two unique sources of data the Australian Migration Database (AIM) and the 2003 Longitudinal Survey of Australia Youth (LSAY). The report begins by establishing the aims of the analyses before proceeding to review previous work on migration as a way to establish the conceptual framework for exploring the movements of young adults up and down the urban hierarchy as they transition from school to higher education and work. Then, the document describes the two data sources and methodological approach used for the analyses, and identifies main issues that prevent the disaggregation of LSAY data at a lower spatial scale than a dichotomous metro-regional approach. Using data from the AIM database, the spatial patterns of young people in Victoria are explored before we focus on the sequences of these moves to determine the extent and timing of return migration to regional Victoria by drawing on data from the 2003 LSAY. This report ends by outlining the way forward for the project by describing the approach that will be adopted to tackle the original research questions, and the way this report fits under these questions.
