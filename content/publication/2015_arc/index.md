abstract: This report addresses the fourth research question of the Australian Research Council (ARC) Linkage project (LP120100212) How have these pathways, transitions and choices altered over time, and what role is played by shifts in the global, regional and local context? Specifically, this report examines the changes in pathways, transitions and choices of three cohorts of young Victorians as they move from school to further education and work. It examines changes in the pathways, transitions and choices of young Victorians in regard to educational aspirations and in educational achievement and labour market outcomes, and explores differences between three groups of school leavers.
