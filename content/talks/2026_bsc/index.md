abstract: Population dynamics-migration, redistribution, ageing, and urban change-are notoriously difficult to predict accurately, particularly at fine spatio-temporal resolutions. Population can shift rapidly and unevenly, while spatial data are often sparse, misaligned across scales, or temporally delayed. Traditional analytical approaches rely on hand-crafted variable features and task-specific models that rarely generalise across regions or contexts. This talk argues that granular population dynamics should be understood fundamentally as a representation problem. Geospatial foundation models offer a paradigm shift by learning reusable embeddings of places from large, heterogeneous, multi-source spatial data. Rather than engineering variables for each outcome, these models learn latent representations that encode complex human-environment interactions and act as spatial priors when outcome data are sparse or noisy. I will outline how geospatial embeddings enable spatial interpolation, extrapolation, super-resolution, and forecasting augmentation across key societal challenges, including census gaps, shocks and crises, urban inequality, migration and displacement and deprivation mapping. By decoupling representation learning from downstream inference, these models support reusable and transferable spatial reasoning across multiple population applications. The talk concludes by discussing frontier technical and conceptual challenges-including scale, comparability, data coverage, and causal interpretation-and argues that while foundation models do not solve all problems in population science, they significantly expand what is observable and inferable under conditions of uncertainty and change.
