abstract: Administrative areas do not accurately reflect the contemporary spatial manifestation of labour market linkages. Local labour market areas (LLMAs) have been shown to provide a better representation of geographic labour market activity. Traditionally LLMAs are delineated based on commuting flow data. However, commuting data are expensive to collect, are sporadically collected in developed countries and rarely available in less developed countries. Yet, recent advances in computing capacity and increased availability of satellite imagery offers a unique opportunity to generate LLMAs in poor environment context in a cheap, frequent and automated way. This papers aims to develop an automated satellite-based approach to define LLMAs.
