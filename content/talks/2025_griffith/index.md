abstract: "Climate-induced population displacement is a global challenge, with wide-ranging consequences for global stability and human welfare. Climate change is accelerating and amplifying the drivers of population movement. Previous empirical work has analysed the isolated, direct and immediate impacts of climate change on human mobility largely focusing on temperature and precipitation. While necessary, temperature and precipitation changes are not a sufficient condition to generate population movement. They trigger mobility if they translate into tangible environmental changes (e.g. drought or flooding). Missing is robust empirical evidence to understand the effects of different types of slow- and sudden-onset hazard events, and their compounded effects on population movements. By spatially integrating population, socio-economic and disaster data from Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, WorldPop and NASA, this paper aims to provide a global analysis of the effects of slow- and sudden-onset hazards, and their compounded effects on population movements over a 15-year period (2008-2023). Preliminary findings show that population displacement has not increased steadily over time despite a large historical growth in the number of rapid-onset natural hazards. Flooding and storms have systematically remained the most prevalent natural hazards. Rapid-onset hazards have concentrated in more vulnerable communities characterised by high deprivation, triggering disproportionately larger population displacement. We expect that areas impacted by the compounded effects of rapid- and slow-onset hazards have the largest flows of population displacement globally. We expect that our findings advance our knowledge of the full range of impacts of sudden- and slow-onset climate events on population displacement, and inform the development of anticipatory climate adaptation and disaster management action plans."
