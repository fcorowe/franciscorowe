abstract: Understanding inequalities at the is key to inform policy. Neighbourhoods are the key of society and urban spaces. Key social processes occur at the neighbourhood level. Yet, lack of offering longitudinal data on places over a long window of time in spatial framework and variable definition over time represent key limitations to develop a long-term longitudinal understanding of spatial inequalities. In this talk, I will present a data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning and sequence analysis to define representative place-based trajectories of inequality.
