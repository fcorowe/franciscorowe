abstract: The rapid expansion of digital trace data has transformed the empirical foundations of population and mobility research. High-frequency, high-resolution streams derived from mobile phones, apps, and satellite imagery offer unprecedented opportunities to monitor spatial patterns, behavioural change, and exposure in near real time. Yet these data are not collected for research purposes and are shaped by persistent and evolving digital divides, platform-specific engagement, and selective coverage. As a result, they provide powerful but biased "windows" onto population processes rather than population-level measurements.

  This seminar presents a general, replicable framework for evaluating, adjusting, and validating mobility indicators derived from digital trace data. Building on work from the Geographic Data Science Lab and the DEBIAS initiative, the framework proceeds in three stages: (1) systematic quantification and explanation of bias using benchmark data; (2) Bayesian multilevel modelling to estimate unobserved flows and adjust for source-specific distortions; and (3) validation through correspondence analysis and cross-source comparison. This approach treats bias not as noise to be ignored, but as a measurable and modelable component of data generation.

  Beyond mobile phone data, the talk situates this work within a broader data ecosystem that integrates satellite imagery and geospatial AI through the Imago Data Service for Imagery. By developing open data products (e.g., CLiVE, EMBED2Social, EXHALE), reproducible tools, and partnerships with statistical offices and international organisations, this programme advances a shift from opportunistic signal extraction to robust population inference. The overarching objective is to enable defensible, policy-relevant measurement of mobility, vulnerability, and exposure across the rural-urban continuum, strengthening the methodological infrastructure required for decision-making in an era of rapid social and environmental change.
