abstract: Immigration is a key ingredient for social cohesion and economic development. Yet, it is often portrayed as a major threat to national identity, values, economic stability and security, particularly during challenging times, like the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturns. With the rise of new technology, much of the discussions around migration and anti-sentiment creation happens online, but little is understood about its development and structure. Using machine learning and network science methods, we aim to study the properties and structure of the tweet network of the debate around migration, analysing the spread, speed and key creators on this network. Key findings provide evidence of a rise in anti-migration sentiment and a small network but highly active number of anti-migrant accounts. We identified key ‘creators’ or ‘spreaders’ of anti-migration sentiment. Results also highlighted the presence of potential ‘counter-hate’ which manifested through a rise in positive sentiment towards migrants or migration following peaks of negative sentiment. An investigation into the role and influence of bots revealed a high number of suspended accounts in the anti-migration network. A scale-free topology of the network shows that a small number of active users drive the spread of anti-migration sentiment. This implies that a targeted approach to tackling online hate could limit the rise in hate crimes towards migrants. This research demonstrates the need for an ongoing framework to monitor and tackle anti-migration sentiment on social media.
