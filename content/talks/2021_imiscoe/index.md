summary: In 2020, countries around the world started facing unprecedented challenges of understanding and tackling the spread and impacts of COVID-19. Amid vital efforts to understand the public health and economic of the pandemic, the rapid spread of discrimination and xenophobia against specific population groups, especially migrants and individuals of Asian descent, has largely been neglected. Understanding public attitudes towards migration is essential to counter discrimination against immigrants and promote social cohesion. Traditional data sources typically used to monitor public opinionâ€” ethnographies, interviews, or surveys - usually rely on small samples, but they are slow to collect, take time to process and become available particularly in a pandemic setting. New forms of data, particularly from social media, can help overcome these limitations. While some bias exists, social media data are produced at an unprecedented temporal frequency, geographical granularity, and accessible in real-time. Drawing on Twitter data, this study seeks to measure shifts in public sentiment opinion about migration in the pre- and pandemic periods (December 2019-April 2020) in five countries (UK, US, Spain, Italy, Germany), drawing on a dataset of 34.92 million Tweets and natural language processing. Results show an increase of immigration-related Tweets along with rising numbers of COVID-19 cases during national lockdowns in all five observed countries; yet, we found no evidence of a significant increase in anti-immigration sentiment in our sample as rises in the volume of negative messages are offset by comparable increases in positive messages. Our results also indicate that the debate around migration is highly polarized and that a distinctive set of topics tends to dominate this debate in the five countries in our sample.
