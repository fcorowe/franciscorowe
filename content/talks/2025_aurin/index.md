abstract: "In 2022, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) launched Smart Data Research UK (SDR UK) to harness the vast potential of 'smart data'—digital traces generated through everyday interactions with digital devices and services—to address pressing societal challenges. In our increasingly digital society, activities such as online shopping, social media engagement, and use of navigation systems produce extensive data. These 'smart data' offer valuable insights into human behaviour, economic trends, and societal patterns. However, researchers have faced significant barriers in accessing and utilising smart data sources effectively due to challenges related to data usability, infrastructure and ethical considerations. At the Geographic Data Science Lab of the University of Liverpool, we have received funding to contribute overcoming these obstacles. Specifically we are leading the development and running of a national data service and an accelerator project which, respectively, seek to unlock the power of satellite imagery and mobile phone data to address pressing social, economic and environmental challenges. I will talk about the rationale of these projects, current progress and future plans."
