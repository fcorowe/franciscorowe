abstract: "Access to human mobility data is key for a wider variety of social challenges, including urban planning, sustainability, public health and economic development. Location trace data collected through digital technology, such as mobile applications have become widely available to study human mobility, and overcome key limitations of traditional data streams, such as surveys and censuses. Yet, digital trace data are not representative of the general population, and consequently require statistical adjustment to mitigate existing biases and make robust statistical inferences. While efforts have been made to correct human mobility data from digital sources, no generalisable solution has been proposed to satisfactorily adjust human mobility flows by attributes at the origin and destination areas. I will present the work of newly ESRC-funded project DEBIAS which aims to develop a generalisable framework to measure, assess and correct existing biases in human mobility data extracted from digital trace data. First, I will present a measure to quantify biases in spatial population counts derived from mobile phone applications, and identify key demographic, socioeconomic and geographic features underlying these biases. Second, I will introduce the proposed framework to mitigate biases in spatial population count data, and generate bias-adjusted human mobility counts from mobile phone applications. Third, I will present our plans for future work on this area."
