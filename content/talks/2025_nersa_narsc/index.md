abstract: "Technological advances have enabled the emerge of ‘Big Data’ through the production, processing, analysis and storage of large volumes of digital information. Data that could not previously be stored, or used to be captured through analogue devices, can now be digitally recorded. These data offer high geographic and temporal granularity, extensive coverage and instant information to measure and transform our understanding of human mobility. Substantively, studies unleashing the attributes of digital footprint data have contributed to expanding existing theories, developing new explanations, adopting new analytical tools and infrastructures, and advancing new areas of research, such as computational social science and geographic data science. Yet, these data also present major epistemological, methodological and ethical challenges. This talk identifies these challenges and discusses current practices and potential opportunities for future research."
