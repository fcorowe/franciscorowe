abstract: The global challenge of internal displacement, exacerbated by conflict, climate change, and natural hazards, requires innovative and collaborative approaches to ensure effective responses. Today, millions of individuals and families face displacement, with 3.7 million in Ukraine among the most recent examples of communities uprooted by crisis (IOM, 2025). These figures are a stark reminder of the need for timely, accurate, and spatially detailed data and accessible ways to process it to inform humanitarian action and policy. This project, a collaboration between the University of Liverpool (UoL), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and other academic and operational partners, conducts a comparative analysis of three datasets-official International Organization for Migration (IOM) survey estimates, GPS phone data, and social media data-to triangulate and refine population displacement estimates. By leveraging these diverse datasets, the project aims to enhance the precision and reliability of displacement estimates. The case study of Ukraine illustrates the power of this approach to generate actionable insights in diverse and complex settings. Importantly, this work has been developed in close partnership with operational agencies, ensuring its relevance to real-world needs and its potential to inform evidence-based decision making. The project includes three policy-focused workshops to foster dialogue between academic and policy institutions. A report will also be co-published in July 2025 reporting on displacement indicators including improved data integration tools, and an easy-to-read methodology document with reproducible code.
