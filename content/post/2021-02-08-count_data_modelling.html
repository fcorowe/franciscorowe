<h1>A Quick Practical Guide</h1>
<p>One of my research areas of interest revolves around understanding human mobility and migration flows. Key attributes of flow data are that they are counts and a right-skewed, overdispesed and often zero-inflated distribution. And I was interested in measuring the variability in region-specific intercepts and slopes in a multilevel modelling framework in R! So, I decided to test the most commonly used R packages to fit four different variants: Poisson, Zero-inflated Poisson, Negative Binomial and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial models - and I wrote a quick practical guide to do this using three R packages: <code>glmmTMB()</code>, <code>glmer()</code> or <code>glmer.nb()</code>, and <code>lme4</code>. I wrote the tweet thread when I did this here:</p>
