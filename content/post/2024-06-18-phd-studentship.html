<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>This project aims to determine the role of the spatial structure of urban activities and spatial socioeconomic segregation on the speed and geography of infectious disease spreading across socioeconomic groups. The research involves a partnership with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency">UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)</a>, and will seek to learn lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic for future health crises, drawing on Second Generation Surveillance System and Respiratory DataMart data. Specifically, the project seeks to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determine the extent to which differences in the spatial structure of urban activities shape the rate of disease transmission;</p></li>
<li><p>Assess how different configurations of the spatial structure of urban activities relate to variations in local levels of socioeconomic segregation;</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate differences in the effects of nonphamaceuthical interventions on contagion exposure across different socioeconomic groups as a function of the spatial structure of urban activities and socioeconomic segregation.</p></li>
</ul>
