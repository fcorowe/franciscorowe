## Description

This course offers an introduction to statistics and supervised machine learning. It adopts a problem-to-solution teaching approach, defining a practical problem and illustrating how statistics can enable understanding to make critically informed decisions about a population by examining a random sample. It uses a learning-by-doing approach based on real-world examples in various contexts. This also teaches how to conduct statistical data analysis in R. The course is organised around 6 sessions. Each session is designed to provide a combination of key statistical concepts and practical application through the use of R.
