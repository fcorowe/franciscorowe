## Description

This course offers an introduction to {{<hl>}}statistics and supervised machine learning{{</hl>}}. It adopts a problem-to-solution teaching approach, defining a practical problem and illustrating how statistics can enable understanding to make critically informed decisions about a population by examining a random sample. It uses a learning-by-doing approach based on real-world examples in various contexts. This also teaches how to conduct statistical data analysis in R. The course is organised around 6 sessions. Each session is designed to provide a combination of key statistical concepts and practical application through the use of R.

## Learning outcomes

Having successfully completed this course, you will be able to:

- Conduct exploratory statistical data analysis.
- Have an understanding of elementary probability distributions and data types.
- Perform correlation and regression data analysis using real-world data.
- Assess the statistical significance between different data types.
- Carry out statistical data analysis in R.
- Have a basic understanding of supervised machine learning and cross-validation.

## Structure

The notes for each session are:

- Session 1 [**Introduction to R**](https://fcorowe.github.io/sl/d1n1_intro.html): Data types & probability distributions

- Session 2 [**Descriptive Statistics**](https://fcorowe.github.io/sl/d1n2_summary.html): Measures of centrality & dispersion for continuous & categorical data

- Session 3 [**Statistical Significance**](https://fcorowe.github.io/sl/d1n3_confidence.html): Hypothesis testing & confidence intervals

- Session 4 [**Correlation**](https://fcorowe.github.io/sl/d2n1_correlation.html): Correlation visualisation & measures

- Session 5 [**Regression Analysis**](https://fcorowe.github.io/sl/d2n2_regression.html): Linear regression, dummy variables & logistic regression

- Session 6 [**Supervised Machine Learning**](https://fcorowe.github.io/sl/d2n3_machinelearning.html): Tree Regressions, Random Forest & Cross-validation
