## Description

This course offers an introduction to Geographic Data Science for Public Policy. It provides a general framework to develop understanding of the ways in which geographic data analytics can be used to turn raw data into actionable information that can inform decision making. The course adopts a problem-to-solution teaching approach, defining a practical problem and illustrating how geographic data science can enable understanding to make critically informed decisions. It uses a learning-by-doing approach based on real-world examples. This also teaches how to conduct statistical and geographic data analysis in R.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the module, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of core geographic data science concepts and tools;
- Understand how to programmatically import, manipulate, visualise, map and analyse geographic data frames;
- Apply geographic modelling techniques to real world data;
- Develop critical skills to design a research project.
