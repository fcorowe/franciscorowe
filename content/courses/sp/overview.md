## Module aims

This module aims to:

* build upon the more general research training delivered via companion modules on *Data Collection and Data Analysis*, which have an aspatial focus;
* highlight the spatial dimension of key social issues;
* explain the specific challenges faced when attempting to analyse spatial data;
* introduce a range of analytical techniques and approaches suitable for spatial data analysis; and,
* enhance practical skills in using software packages to implement spatial analytical tools.

## Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students should be able to:

* identify some key sources of spatial data and resources of spatial analysis and modelling tools;
* explain the advantages of taking hierarchical structure of spatial data into account for data analysis;
* apply a range of computer-based techniques for the analysis of spatial data, including mapping, correlation, kernel density estimation, regression, multi-level models, geographically-weighted regression, spatial interaction models and spatial econometrics;
* apply appropriate analytical strategies to tackle the key methodological challenges facing spatial analysis – spatial autocorrelation, heterogeneity, and ecological fallacy; and, 
* select appropriate analytical tools for analysing specific spatial data sets to address emerging social issues facing the society

Achievement of these outcomes will be assessed via coursework.

## Module Delivery

The module is structured around weekly lecture and practical sessions, involving 9 teaching sessions and 3 clinic sessions - one before each module assignment. The teaching sessions provide both theoretical exposition and hands-on practical experience of the issues and challenges on handling spatial data and a wide range of analytical tools for their analysis and modelling.

Access to materials, including computational notebooks, is centralised through the use of a course website available in the following url: **franciscorowe.com/courses/sp/**

Specific readings, videos, and/or podcasts, as well as academic references will be provided for each lecture and practical session, and can be accessed through the course website.

## Software

The module will use R as the primary software package. 

### On Campus PCs

If not pre-installed ie. no R and RStudio icons on your desktop:

* Right-click on the Windows icon at the bottom left of the screen
* Scroll down the list of available programs to find the *Install University Applications* option and click on this option
* Respond ‘Yes’ ‘Allow to make changes to this PC’ prompt
* Select the Statistics category
* Select the RStudio

This will automatically install both R and RStudio

### Personal computers

To install R, go to http://www.r-project.org/ > CRAN > select *mirror* site > and download and install the version relevant to your computer.

To install RStudio go to http://www.rstudio.com and download the relevant *Installer for supported platforms*.

## Feedback

Written feedback on the summative assignment will be provided within three working weeks of the
submission deadline.

Verbal feedback on understandings of all module material will be provided during lectures and labs sessions if requested. Students will also be offered the opportunity for one-to-one feedback, should they require it.
